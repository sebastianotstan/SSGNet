# SSGNet
SSGNet is a framework for data-efficient medical imaging that integrates class-specific StyleGAN3 generation with iterative semi-supervised pseudo-labeling. It enlarges datasets, alleviates class imbalance, and improves classification and segmentation performance across multiple benchmarks under limited annotations.
